HOLIDAY NOTICE: Reviews and decisions for proposals received in December will likely be delayed due to the holiday season. Thank you for your understanding in advance.
Swiss AI Initiative - Call for Small Grants


This is the document for the small grants. For the large grants, see here.
Overview
AI advances are progressing at a speed and scale never seen before, with unprecedented opportunities for disruptive breakthrough applications. However, the centralization of this key technology by a small set of private companies poses risks regarding system transparency & reliability, protection of intellectual property & personal data, and alignment with societal values. Addressing these risks is urgent as societal institutions are not adapted to the disruption and impact of an accelerated pace of AI deployment. The next five years will be pivotal in setting the norms for the safe development and societal integration of AI technologies. 


To unleash the benefits and mitigate the risks of these technologies for the Swiss economy and society, the Swiss AI initiative was created to build capacities for advanced large-scale trustworthy AI systems. The Swiss AI Initiative is operated by the Swiss National AI Institute (co-founded by ETH Zurich and EPFL). It brings together the leading AI researchers across Switzerland, leverages one of the world’s leading AI supercomputers (with over 10’000 GH200 GPUs) managed by the National Supercomputing Center (CSCS), and fosters collaborations among various Swiss stakeholders (academic institutions, industry, start-ups, federal administration, and the public sector). The Initiative will provide artifacts such as transparent and open software, models, and data releases, enabling their trustworthy use by various Swiss stakeholders, including SMEs and start-ups. 


Through this collaboration, the Swiss AI Initiative will develop large-scale foundation models (the base of modern AI) that can reliably operate in multiple domains of core societal and economic interest, and develop new methods for large-scale training, multimodal integration, multilingual generality, alignment to societal values, uncertainty quantification, and sustainable learning. These developed systems will be aligned with the needs of Swiss stakeholders, enabling safe and effective deployment in sectors of importance for societal advancement and stability: education, law, climate, and more. Finally, the Swiss AI Initiative will engage with policymakers and associations to provide guidance & recommendations on effective policy and regulation around AI deployment that promotes economic growth while protecting the interests of Swiss citizens.
Small Project Grants
In line with the above goals, the Swiss AI Initiative provides funding to support the research and development of open science artifacts in core areas of foundation model development, as well as target application areas of critical societal importance.


Small project grants are allocated for a period of six months, and provide access to the CSCS Alps infrastructure and compute resources for AI projects that require large-scale training, evaluation, and deployment capabilities to be realized. Typically, the compute amount requested might be between 20k and 50k compute hours, though smaller amounts are also possible. An overall goal is that after completion, successful small project grants could lead to a subsequent proposal for a large grant.
Available Resources
In 2025, through this and subsequent calls, we aim to distribute compute resources of 10-20M GPU hours via the small and large compute grants.
