Swiss AI Initiative - Call for Large Grants
Application Guidelines 


This is the document for the large grants. For the small grants, see here.
Introduction
AI advances are progressing at a speed and scale never seen before, with unprecedented opportunities for disruptive breakthrough applications. However, the centralization of this key technology by a small set of private companies poses risks regarding system transparency & reliability, protection of intellectual property & personal data, and alignment with societal values. Addressing these risks is urgent as societal institutions are not adapted to the disruption and impact of an accelerated pace of AI deployment. The next five years will be pivotal in setting the norms for safe development and societal integration of AI technologies. 


To unleash the benefits and mitigate the risks of these technologies for the Swiss economy and society, the Swiss AI initiative was created to build capacities for advanced large-scale trustworthy AI systems. The Swiss AI Initiative is jointly operated by the AI Centers at EPFL and ETH Zurich, under the umbrella of the Swiss National AI Institute (SNAI) co-funded by ETH Zurich and EPFL. It brings together the leading AI researchers across Switzerland, leverages one of the world’s leading AI supercomputers (with over 10’000 GH200 GPUs) managed by the National Supercomputing Center (CSCS), and fosters collaborations among various Swiss stakeholders (academic institutions, industry, start-ups, federal administration, and the public sector). The Initiative will provide artifacts such as transparent and open software, models, and data releases, enabling their trustworthy use by various Swiss stakeholders including SMEs and start-ups. 


Through this collaboration, the Swiss AI Initiative will develop large-scale foundation models (the base of modern AI) that can reliably operate in multiple domains of core societal and economic interest, and develop new methods for large-scale training, multimodal integration, multilingual generality, alignment to societal values, uncertainty quantification, and sustainable learning. These developed systems will be aligned with the needs of Swiss stakeholders, enabling safe and effective deployment in sectors of importance for societal advancement and stability: education, law, climate, and more. Finally, the Swiss AI Initiative will engage with policymakers and associations to provide guidance and recommendations on effective policy and regulation around AI deployment that promotes economic growth while protecting the interests of Swiss citizens.
Large Project Grants - Call for proposals
In line with the above goals, the Swiss AI Initiative provides funding to support the research and development of open science artifacts in core areas of foundation model development, as well as target application areas of critical societal importance.


The Swiss AI Initiative’s main funding instruments are large compute-oriented project grants. 
In 2025, we aim to distribute compute resources of 10-20M GPU hours and more than 2M CHF to fund project-related personnel and research costs. 


* Project Duration: Large project grants are allocated for a period of one year, and provide access to compute resources in the CSCS Alps infrastructure for AI projects that require large-scale training, evaluation, and deployment capabilities to be realized. 
* Computing hours: The compute amount requested can exceed 500K compute hours, though smaller amounts are also possible. Projects are expected to use 2/3 of the compute budget in the first 6 months of the project. 
* Funding: In addition to compute hours, applicants can request funding for personnel and research costs, up to a maximal amount of 1M CHF. See the “Eligible costs” section below for details.
* Engineering Support: A core team of engineers is also available within the Swiss AI Initiative to support large projects. Assistance with different specialized activities (e.g., data curation, scaling, evaluation, platform design) may be requested in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) months. A total of approximately 48 FTE-months of engineer work (approximately 4 full-time engineers) will be available for the funded projects. 


Thematic areas
The call is open for all proposals that align with the goals of the Swiss AI initiative and require considerable computational resources to achieve their aims. Proposals should outline a research agenda that matches several of the following criteria:
* advance core AI capabilities (scalability, efficiency, alignment, safety, multimodal integration or evaluation)
* advance research in AI fundamentals or impact applications of AI
* benefit the Swiss or European or global ecosystem and societal context
* foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and/or collaboration across more than one group
* ensure ethical AI use and regulatory compliance
* promote principles of open science (including open-source, open weights, open data)
* foster participation of various stakeholders, such as public administration, SMEs, Startups, NGOs


For this Call, we are specifically requesting proposals for the following topic domains:

* LLMs
* Multimodality
* AI Safety
* AI for Education
* AI for Science (including biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy and others)
* AI for Health
* AI for Climate & Weather modeling
* AI for Robotics
* Strengthening the interface of AI and democratic processes, including for example media, law and justice, or the public administration

However, proposals in other areas will also be considered.


Eligibility and Requirements
* Proposals for large grants can be submitted by a team of one or more (co-)applicants, with the relevant qualifications and jointly responsible for the project.
* Each team must designate one of the co-applicants as the scientific lead, responsible for representing the team, overseeing all deliverables and reporting requirements, and communicating with SNAI. The scientific lead will also serve as the primary point of contact with CSCS for the assignment, coordination and use of allocated compute hours.
* The scientific lead must have an affiliation with an ETH Domain institution (ETH Zurich, EPFL, PSI, WSL, Empa or Eawag) and be employed in a permanent or Professor tenure-track capacity for the whole duration of the project.
* Co-applicants requesting financial resources must have an affiliation with an ETH Domain institution, be in a position to receive funding and to carry out independent research in a permanent or Professor tenure-track capacity for the whole duration of the project.
* Cross-institutional collaborations are strongly encouraged: computational resources can be accessed by co-applicants affiliated to academic institutions outside of the ETH Domain, such as cantonal universities, universities of applied sciences, and foreign public academic institutions.
* Proposals may include additional partners (not requesting nor accessing any resources), such as administrations, NGOs, SMEs, or Startups.
* The access to compute resources in Alps is conditioned by the CSCS General Terms and Conditions and User Regulations applicable to the Swiss AI Initiative. 
* Any eligible applicant can lead or participate in more than one proposal.


Eligible costs
Eligible costs are limited to the following:
* Personnel costs: Salaries and social charges for staff directly involved in the project, including doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and other employees (e.g. technical assistants).
Applicants whose salaries are secured by their own institutions (such as Assistant, Associate, or Full Professors) may not use funds to pay their own salaries or consulting fees.
Requested personnel funds require equivalent matching funds by the applicants. In case matching funds are provided through another grant, it is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that the conditions of the grant permit such use in the context of this Swiss AI call. Requests for engineering FTE hours provided by engineers of the Swiss AI Initiative do not need to be matched.
All personnel costs (requested funds and matching funds) should be justified with an expected list of activities (under point c. Activities of the project proposal) for all requested positions, along with a clear demonstration of feasibility with respect to timing.
* Research expenses (including VAT): This includes specific equipment and materials required for the project, funds for technology transfer, outreach and communications, networking activities, public events, conferences and workshops directly related to the project. Subcontracting costs are not covered under research expenses for this call.


Funds allocated by the Swiss AI Initiative need to be used during the official project duration.
